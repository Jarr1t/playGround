## Heading ##
 > PlayGround

## Sub-Heading ##
  > An app to help all New Yorkers go outside and have fun again.

## Summary ##
  > The PlayGround application allows a user to rate their local park in New York City. The user can rate by cleanliness, location, and amenities. The user has the ability to sign up to volunteer to clean up a park or schedule community events. The app lists park guidelines such as park hours of operation and whether guests can grill, play music, etc.

## Problem ##
  > To help bring communities that were divided by covid together again. Covid-19 was a big impact on all of us, communities were stretched thin, with no social interaction for over a year. 
  
## Solution ##
  > This app provides information about local parks in NYC to give users the confidence to get outdoors again. By providing park rating statistics communities collectively show support for their local parks and have the ability to help the park improve through volunteering and events.

## Key Technical Challenge ##
  > One of the biggest technical challenges for us would be having to fetch from multiple APIs to gather all the necessary information we need.

## Extension Opportunities ##
  > One of the goals of our project is to address the lack of social interaction and the effects it has had on our communities one additional feature would be a message board so people can help others or talk about your problems with others that could be feeling the same. Provide links to resources for mental health and ways to cope.  
  > Another feature would be a map of homeless shelters and local donation centers.
